Group Project for course CPCS-331 (Artificial Intelligence I)

Nonograms, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid of size (n x m) must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture, Each number indicates the number of coloured cells on that row/column.

This repository is forked from Mario Cervera's repository Nonogram, and modified to solve nanograms using backtracking and AC-3 algorithms.This program works in netbeans. The file named NonogramSolver is the package that will be placed inside a source package for a netbeans projec, while the inputFiles file should be placed in the project file. you should run the file named "NonogramSolverUI.java".
