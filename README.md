# NonogramSolver

Group Project for course CPCS-331 (Artificial Intelligence I)
Nonograms, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid of size (n x m) must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture, Each number indicates the number of colored cells on that row/column.
This repository is forked from Mario Cervera's repository Nonogram and modified to solve nonograms using backtracking and AC-3 algorithms. AC-3 algorithm used from the page: https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Nonogram_solver#Java. This program works in NetBeans. The file named NonogramSolver is the package that will be placed inside a source package for a NetBeans project, while the input files file should be placed in the project file. You should run the file named NonogramSolverUI.java
